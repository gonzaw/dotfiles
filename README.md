# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. It's a fork of https://github.com/holman/dotfiles, using bash instead of zsh, with some other changes.
The installation process is exactly the same

## Installation

The installation process is the same as Holman's

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gonzaw/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

## Thanks

Thanks to [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) for his comprehensive and easy to use dotfiles.
